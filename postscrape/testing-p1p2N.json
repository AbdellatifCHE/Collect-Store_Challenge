For Latour, these two protagonists \u201cinhabit different planets \u2013 Trump\u2019s is without limits, and Greta\u2019s is trembling and terribly finite; we realise we hardly know it, and it is changing out of control.\u201d", "Lowering his massive eyebrows for dramatic effect, Latour says that science has \u201calways had to theatricalise proof\u201d in order to change perceptions. \u201cPasteur was quite a showman, flogging a non-vaccinated laboratory sheep to prove it had really died of its ailments, taking a crowd into a vineyard to prove \u2013 to an incredulous Burgundy winemaker \u2013 that he could sterilise bad bacteria.

I think this kind of thought is really needed today, in the age of climate emergency.", " I learned from Latour that architecture is a loose assembly of small objects, and the product of collaborative work that takes place between objects and people. This enabled me to completely break away from the egotistical point of view of many architects who think they are absolute and hold a privileged position. My architectural designs changed when I started to think in this manner. It allowed my designs to be clearly visualised as an assembly or ensemble of small objects.

Mr J Hoseason was in the chair.", "Mr W Thomson was the advocate of the metric system as a simple and scientific standard. After speaking of the share which Commons and Lords had had in discussing the question, he put forward as reasons for a change from existing standards, that the metric system was used by almost all civilised countries, that it would save children a great deal of time and labour at school, and that in all departments of life it would make the calculation of weights and measures an easier and quicker task.", "Mr Thomson made many points against present-day methods, and mentioned some of the anomalies of the system \u2013 the bushel of potatoes that weighs 224lb in Cornwall but weighs only 84lb in Nottingham, the stone that equalled 14lb in a live animal but only 8lb when the animal was killed, and so forth.", "An official of the Bank of England had stated, he said, that if this country had decimal coinage \u2013 another reform to be sought \u2013 the country would save \u00a320,000 a year in the clerical staffing of its Customs department alone. All those points and many others were explained and elaborated in detail.", "Mr J Moore, of the ", ", took the opposite side. He asked why it was that America, one of the most pushful and modern of nations, had stuck to the inch and foot and pound as standards. He argued, moreover, that though the metric system was made compulsory by law in several European countries, the tendency of manufacturers and others is those countries was to get back to the British standard. In France, he said, there was more manufacturing done in units other than metric units than there was in metric units.", "In the woollen industry of France there was the English system; it was the same in the linen and, with a few exceptions, in the cotton industry. The change was simply the survival of the fittest. In Germany, too, several large chambers of commerce were agitating to get the mark divided other than decimally as a means of facilitating \u201cthe giving of change.\u201d Mr Moore went into a long defence of English methods as they are, though he admitted that some improvements were necessary and were being sought by the Weights and Measures Association."]},
