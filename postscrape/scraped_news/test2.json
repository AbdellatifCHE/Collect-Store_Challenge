Anning never married and is not known to have had any direct descendants, but a report in the Telegraph suggested her distant relatives were at odds over the film’s central relationship, a romance between Anning and Charlotte Murchison.', 'Barbara Anning was quoted as saying: “I do not believe there is any evidence to back up portraying her as a gay woman.” She added: “Do the film-makers have to resort to using unconfirmed aspects to somebody’s sexuality to make an already remarkable story sensational? This adds nothing to her story.” Another relative, Lorraine Anning, took a different view: “To be honest, it doesn’t matter; as long as it’s well presented and tastefully done and in the spirit of Mary Anning, then I think it’s brilliant.”', 'The film’s writer and director, Francis Lee, previously responsible for indie hit God’s Own Country, responded with a series of posts on social media. He wrote: “After seeing queer history be routinely ‘straightened’ throughout culture, and given a historical figure where there is no evidence whatsoever of a heterosexual relationship, is it not permissible to view that person within another context?” He added: “Would these newspaper writers have felt the need to whip up uninformed quotes from self-proclaimed experts if the character’s sexuality had been assumed to be heterosexual?”', 'Would these newspaper writers have felt the need to whip up uninformed quotes from self proclaimed experts if the character’s sexuality had been assumed to be heterosexual?', 'Anning, who died in 1847 aged 47, is renowned for a series of discoveries she made while fossil collecting in the rock formations around Lyme Regis. As the poorly educated daughter of a cabinet-maker she received little official credit for her work during her lifetime; her reputation has steadily increased since.']"}

But to properly explain the underlying changes to climate they will need to look much further afield at the weather across the world, reporting and analysing extremes on a daily basis.', '“So I am calling on the BBC and the other major broadcasters to incorporate an additional five- to 10-minute slot into the forecast that focuses properly and honestly on the Earth’s changing climate.', '“This climate change slot should air at least once a week and would use our technical ability to show weather everywhere in the world to explain in clear, ‘non-jargony’ or technical terms the reasons why our climate is changing – largely due to human influences – and the effects of this on us and all other animals.”', 'The forecaster, who says he has been highlighting the effects of climate change since the 1980s, warns: “If our mathematics are correct, then a 2C change will mean that the London summer climate in 2050 would be similar to that of southern France of today – and by 2100 similar to that of Athens.”', 'A BBC spokesman said: “BBC Weather is already looking at climate change very carefully to see how we can communicate its impacts, particularly on extreme weather events both in the UK and around the world.”', 'Asked whether it backed Giles’s calls, the Met Office said it “welcomes any opportunities to raise awareness and promote the science of climate change”.', 'A spokesman added: “As our climate changes, so will the weather we experience on a day to day basis. Working with the media to increase understanding of the science behind how the likelihood of heatwaves, floods or storms may change in the future should be welcomed.”']"}
