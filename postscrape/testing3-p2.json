But also no, because before coming to its senses the initial government response did hark back to Sars: a kneejerk cover-up, presumably born of an unwillingness to admit that a major crisis could be in the offing. As a result, the scourge went unchecked for days, allowing people to spread the disease widely within China\u2019s borders and, inevitably, outside them.

Viruses do not respect rules, and they do not always act predictably. They have one sole purpose: to create copies of themselves and to pass them on. They have no innate malevolence, but simply the imperative to find a new host in which to survive, as without such protection they will perish. A \u201chot\u201d virus in a remote village may kill off all of its potential hosts before it has a chance to spread; a pandemic virus has to be more subtle.", "To an emerging pathogen, hosts of a different species present both a threat and an opportunity. Faced with a wild west of unfamiliar tissues and inhospitable docking points, the cross-species incursion is often a very short ride. Yet a potential paradise awaits those that can adapt: an immune system that will give it an initial pass because it has never encountered it before, and an entire population for further onward transmission. Thrust into a crucible of pure natural selection, the virus can throw off millions of slight mutants of itself in the hope that one of them will \u201cstick\u201d \u2013 allowing safe passage into accommodating tissue, subverting our cells into dutiful photocopiers, tickling the lungs into coughing fits to propel its progeny towards the next victim.

This is why we must avoid the temptation to put all our eggs in one basket; it would surely be a mistake to blow the budget on coronavirus research when the next thing may well turn out to be something entirely different.", "As we can\u2019t predict which pathogen will give us grief, the most important thing we can do is to invest in preparedness itself. Don\u2019t get me wrong: great science is compelling stuff, and I\u2019ve been impressed with how quickly the scientific community has responded. Advances in so-called ", " circumvent the need for virus isolation and biological experimentation: all you need is the blueprint, and you\u2019re good to go. Within days of the Chinese sequencing the virus, a number of labs used the published code to start crafting a vaccine based on genetic material. It\u2019s early days, as no DNA vaccine has yet been licensed for use, but it\u2019s clear that in a relatively short time this technology will become a lifesaver.", "But as amazing as our science has and will become, it is probably public health and prevention that will do the lion\u2019s share of keeping us safe. Worthy, boring activities such as legislating against situations where people can come into contact easily with exotic animals; increasing the availability and uptake of hand sanitisers; developing more effective mass-produced masks; enhanced port-of-entry surveillance; incentivising open communication about outbreaks in cultures in which such candour is problematic; getting better at hospital management, triage and life-support of the critically ill.", "None of this comes cheaply \u2013 the world\u2019s governments need to set aside significant funding. Much as for climate change, countries will have to accept the need to ringfence money even though the worst has not yet happened.

It concludes with two stark images: a Last Supper-like shot of the Biarritz G7 climate summit table, with an empty chair for Trump-Judas; and the iconic glimpse of Greta Thunberg scowling as Trump eclipses her at the UN. For Latour, these two protagonists \u201cinhabit different planets \u2013 Trump\u2019s is without limits, and Greta\u2019s is trembling and terribly finite; we realise we hardly know it, and it is changing out of control.\u201d", "Lowering his massive eyebrows for dramatic effect, Latour says that science has \u201calways had to theatricalise proof\u201d in order to change perceptions. \u201cPasteur was quite a showman, flogging a non-vaccinated laboratory sheep to prove it had really died of its ailments, taking a crowd into a vineyard to prove \u2013 to an incredulous Burgundy winemaker \u2013 that he could sterilise bad bacteria. Unfortunately though, in France, our rationalism has now flattened out this kind of thing.\u201d", "There is nothing remotely flat, however, about Latour\u2019s considerable, rambunctious, haunting work in the theatre, and nothing flat about the suffering Earth it urgently brings to our attention. Latour made his name \u2013 as a sociologist \u2013 questioning the construction of scientific truth, and now finds himself ardently defending it against multiple agents of division and obfuscation. He cites Brexit and Trump as parallel forces seeking to unravel a richly networked, cooperative world. Aged 72, with nothing to prove professionally, he is accelerating his efforts to bring these difficult questions before a broad, non-specialist audience.", "Latour has inspired an unusually wide range of thinkers and creators. The sociologist ", " describes him as \u201cthe most creative intellectual of our generation\u201d and adds: \u201cHe has always opened doors, showing unexpected scenes and spaces which need thinking about.\u201d For his inner circle, Latour is considered a masterful pathfinder who encourages others to find their own ways.

They did 10 hours on microbes!\u2019", "The jolly am-dram character of his approach would eventually prove valuable in dealing with urgent contemporary matters.

When Bruno was preparing the ", " [which became his book ", "], we were studying science dramatists such as Tom Stoppard and Michael Frayn, and simultaneously improvising what became our next show, Gaia Global Circus. Bruno\u2019s research and the theatre work were mutually supportive. We realised that \u2013 on a stage, unlike in a lecture theatre \u2013 you can show uncertainty, complexity and contentious arguments. A theatre audience \u2013 in real time, with all the riskiness of live performance \u2013 can somehow metabolise more levels of meaning, and experience deeper feelings.\u201d", "In contrast to film and TV, says A\u00eft-Touati, in theatre \u201cyou can work fast, and with minimal means; all you need is people. What we do is genuinely experimental theatre: each show is a learning experience with a different format. The times are moving very fast around us, we have to keep up, to help difficult concepts to emerge to the public.\u201d", "These formats have indeed been diverse: besides the knockabout, sketch-driven Gaia Global Circus, and ", " (in which Latour was presented as a tiny figure adrift in massive projections of geological strata and astronomical diagrams), the pair convened a parallel-reality ", " over three days at the Nanterre-Amandiers theatre in 2015, in which fictional delegates of the soil, air and seas rubbed shoulders with students role-playing the representatives of nation states.

He has taught me to forego commodities in favour of communities. With vigour, freshness, invention, honesty, expansiveness, art and playful humour, he is moving us out of our fantasies of control and mastery back into an embrace of evolving democracy.", " As an artist, I am inspired by Latour\u2019s insistence that humans are not on Earth but in Earth. In his writing and performance-oriented work, he makes the invisible visible by highlighting the networks that everyone and everything are a part of. He is adamantly against silo-thinking, looking instead at interconnectivity and intermingling. I think this kind of thought is really needed today, in the age of climate emergency.", " I learned from Latour that architecture is a loose assembly of small objects, and the product of collaborative work that takes place between objects and people. This enabled me to completely break away from the egotistical point of view of many architects who think they are absolute and hold a privileged position. My architectural designs changed when I started to think in this manner. It allowed my designs to be clearly visualised as an assembly or ensemble of small objects. Therefore, philosophy has the potential to change the shape and form of the world, in addition to changing how the world is viewed.", " Latour\u2019s thought threads through much that I\u2019ve written, particularly over the past five years and especially in ", "; his challenges to the distinctions between modern and pre-modern, and between human and more-than-human, as well as his identification of a \u201cnew climatic regime\u201d, in which social justice and ecological crisis must be recognised as aligned, and short-term interest must (somehow) be subordinated to long-term survival."]},

What\u2019s more, he added, the research reveals the interplay of different evolutionary pressures, such as the need to convey the size of the animal and its identity, all while communicating efficiently.", "Kello welcomed the study. \u201cLinguistic laws, like Zipf\u2019s law of brevity and the Menzerath-Altmann law, were originally discovered in text,\u201d he said, noting that meant it was initially thought that they arose from the symbolic nature of human language.", "\u201cThis new study provides more evidence that the laws are physical and not symbolic, because even penguins show them.

The innermost planet, Mercury\u2019s orbit is just 0.38 times the size of Earth. Being that close to the sun means that we can never see the planet in the night sky but at certain times of the year we can catch a glimpse of it in the twilight. For the next two weeks, Mercury will be visible in the evening as dusk is falling. To see it, a clear south-western horizon will be needed but at least the bright planet Venus is on hand to act as guide. The chart shows the view looking south-west towards Venus at 1730GMT on 3 February. There will be no other stars visible at this time, only Venus and Mercury will shine through the twilight sky. Mercury is much more of a challenge from the southern hemisphere. From Sydney, Australia, Venus will be to the north of Mercury, which just peeps above the western horizon around 2030 AEDT."]}
